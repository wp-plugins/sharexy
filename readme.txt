***A brand new way to earn money and monetize your blog***

Sharexy is the first social bookmarking and sharing tool that brings you money!


**How it works:**

It's simple: we broadcast ads using the widget and you earn with every click!

Display of a relevant pay per click advertising using the sharexy widget does not annoy visitors, distract their attention from the content and require additional space on the website. So, if you are using the "old standard" social sharing buttons, simply replace them with the new Sharexy widget and start earning money immediately!

While selecting ads, we apply powerful contextual technology, which ensures relevant advertising, suitable and attractive offers for your visitors, and a hefty income source  for you.


You've got three options of when to translate ads to the visitors:

**display ads at all times** - visitors will see the ad next to the first widget on the page as soon as they open the page. For instance, if you have a blog and the sharing buttons are placed next to each topic on the main page, ad will only appear next to the first topic. Visitors will also see the ad when sharing a link or hovering a cursor over the Sharexy button."

**Display ads when visitors share the link** - A visitors clicks on of the social network buttons in the widget and most likely they are will temporarily leave your webpage. Having shared the link they get back to your website and see the ad next to the widget.

**When and if the visitor hovers a cursor over the Sharexy button in the widget** - they are sees the ad and additional sharing options.


*You can always turn off the ads broadcasting and use only social sharing features.*


It's all in your hands and it's up to you whether you want to earn money advertising with the help of our new widget or to just use social sharing features.
